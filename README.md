Sentiment Analysis and PCA to analyze any user's tweets and tweeting patterns. 
The default user is accuweather. To change the user, relpace accuweather with any twitter user in the test tweet variable.
Enter your tweepy keys in keys json file to run. I used Juypter Notebook but you can run this in Google colab or anything similar.
